//About my tech stack and the technologies I'm most intrested in
export const Stack: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <div className={utilStyles.textContainer}>
            <p>
                Well hello there! I know you're curious about what my tech stack
                is and what tools I'm using, well right now I'm feeling
                comfortable with:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>React.js</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
                <li>PostgreSQL</li>
                <li>GraphQL</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                That's my prefered stack when I'm working on a full on server +
                client project, however right now I'm enjoying a lot working on
                the frontend and with the JAMstack architecture, my prefered
                technologies for this are:
            </p>

                So, yeah that's my core tech stack currently I've been doing a
                lot of SSG/SSR and overall having a good time with it. Of course
                there are a lot of other tools/libraries that I use for data
                fetching, quering information, JavaScript utilities & more...
            </p>
            <p>Here are some honorable mentions of tools that I use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>React Query</li>
                <li>React SWR</li>
                <li>TypeGraphQL</li>
                <li>TypeORM</li>
                <li>Lodash</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There's a lot more to cover, if you're still intrested on
                knowing more in depth of why I use this tech stack, Check my{" "}
